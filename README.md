A Novel Converter Topology for Standalone Hybrid PV Wind Battery Power System.
Nov 2020 - Dec 2020

A Simulink project was created which integrated and controlled three
different types of power sources to a variable load.

The objective of this project is to propose a multi-input power converter for the hybrid system that interfaces two unidirectional ports for input power sources, a bidirectional port for a storage element, and a port for output load in a unified structure. The two input ports for simultaneously converting two different input power sources with low voltages to a stable output power with a high voltage. According to various situations, the operational states of the proposed converter can be divided into three states based on battery utilization .In order to ensure that the system operates with high efficiency, this project proposes a power management control scheme, which controls the bidirectional converter operating under boost mode according to the operation condition of the PV/Wind , so that the battery can be charged or discharged. The integration of the hybrid renewable power system is implemented and simulated using MATLAB/SIMULINK.

This repo contains all the documentation the mini project and a Power point presentation with easy explanation and can be understandable this repo contains the code to make a working model of the project also.
